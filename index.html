First and foremost, I love writing Code. Ever since I wrote my first program in C / C ++ because I love both programming languages ​​and use them to produce content, I have been concerned about the idea of ​​using software to solve functional / coding problems during my College time. Software engineering is an endless puzzle The problem I have been involved in solving. I believe in the power of the program to change and improve the lives of people around the world.

With my first professional contract, I was given the opportunity to lead a complete overhaul of MERN Stack for a small Portfolio website for a freelancer. This contract quickly turned into a full promise and I have been expanding my role as a software developer and full Stack engineer ever since. Today, I am Student of Lovely Professional University University student and I work with a freelancer website as a freelancer.
